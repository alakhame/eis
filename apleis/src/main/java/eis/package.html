The classes in this package were designed to establish the connection between
APL platforms and environments.

<p/>

The main-interface is <code>EnvironmentInterfaceStandard</code>, which has
to be implemented in order to generate an environment-interface. Alternatively
you can extend the class <code>EIDefaultImpl</code> which is the default
implementation.

<p/>

You can use the <code>EILoader</code> to load environment-interfaces from
jar-files.

<p/>

In oder to allow for notifications by environment interfaces, observers
should implement <code>AgentListener</code> and <code>EnvironmentListener</code>
and attach themselves to the interface.
