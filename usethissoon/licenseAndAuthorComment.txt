Whichever license you plan to use, the process involves adding two
elements to each source file of your program: a copyright notice (such
as “Copyright 1999 Terry Jones”), and a statement of copying permission,
saying that the program is distributed under the terms of the GNU
General Public License (or the Lesser GPL).

The copyright notice should include the year in which you finished
preparing the release (so if you finished it in 1998 but didn't post it
until 1999, use 1998). You should add the proper year for each release;
for example, “Copyright 1998, 1999 Terry Jones” if some versions were
finished in 1998 and some were finished in 1999. If several people
helped write the code, use all their names.

For software with several releases over multiple years, it's okay to use
a range (“2008-2010”) instead of listing individual years (“2008, 2009,
2010”) if and only if every year in the range, inclusive, really is a
“copyrightable” year that would be listed individually; and you make an
explicit statement in your documentation about this usage.

Always use the English word “Copyright”; by international convention,
this is used worldwide, even for material in other languages. The
copyright symbol “©” can be included if you wish (and your character set
supports it), but it's not necessary. There is no legal significance to
using the three-character sequence “(C)”, although it does no harm.
