CURRENT VERSION 0.2

- made getAssociatedEntities and getAssociatedAgents in EnvironmentInterfaceStandard public.
- getAllPerceptsFromEntity throws exceptions now.

  deprecated; the examples have been moved into the eis.examples package

- added a simple version-checking mechanism, the EILoader throw an exception of the interface-to be loaded does not have the expection version
- fixed a bug within notifyAgents
- added getType to EnvironmentInterfaceStandard; implemented getType and setType in EIDefaultImpl
