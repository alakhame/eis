CURRENT VERSION

- made getAssociatedEntities and getAssociatedAgents in EnvironmentInterfaceStandard public.
- getAllPerceptsFromEntity throws exceptions now.
- added the class eis.EILoader for loading interfaces from jar-files; jar-files have to include a main-class-entry
  in the manifest that denotes the class that is the interface; renders the method eis.EnvironmentInterfaceStandard.fromJarFile
  deprecated; the examples have been moved into the eis.examples package
